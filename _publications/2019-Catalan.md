### Abstract

The Catalan triangle is an infinite lower-triangular matrix that generalizes the
Catalan numbers. The entries of the Catalan triangle, denoted by $$c_{n,k}$$, count the
number of shortest lattice paths from $$(0, 0)$$ to $$(n, k)$$ that do not go above the main
diagonal. This paper studies the occurrence of primes and perfect powers in the Catalan
triangle.
