### Abstract

A _barcode_ is a finite multiset of intervals on the real line, $$B = \{ (b_i, d_i)\}_{i=1}^n$$.
Barcodes are important objects in topological data analysis, where they serve as summaries of the persistent homology groups of a filtration.
The combinatorial properties of barcodes have also been studied, mainly in the context of interval orders and interval graphs.
In this paper, we define a new family of maps from the space of barcodes with $$n$$ bars to the permutation sets of various multisets, known as _multipermutations_. These multipermutations provide new combinatorial invariants on the space of barcodes. We then define an order relation on these multipermutations, which we show can be interpreted as a _crossing number_ for barcodes, reminiscent of T\'{u}ran's crossing number for graphs.
Next, we show that the resulting posets are order-isomorphic to principal ideals of a well known poset known as the multinomial Newman lattice. Consequently, these posets form the graded face-lattices of polytopes, which we refer to as _barcode lattices_ or _barcode polytopes_. Finally, we show that for a large class of barcodes, these invariants can provide bounds on the Wasserstein and bottleneck distances between a pair of barcodes, linking these discrete invariants to continuous metrics on barcodes.
