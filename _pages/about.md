This is the personal site of Elena Jaramillo Rodriguez.
I am Data Scientist and AI Product Engineer in Government and Public Services at [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html). My offering portfolio is in Artificial Intelligence and Data Operations.

In June 2023 I received my PhD in Mathematics at [UC Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/ "UCD Math"); my advisor was [Jesus De Loera](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~deloera/ "Jesus De Loera").
I previously earned my MS in Mathematics from UC Davis in 2021 and my BA in Applied Mathematics from [UC Berkeley](https://math.berkeley.edu/ "UCB Math") in 2018.

## Research

My research focused on applied and computational discrete mathematics, with an emphasis on optimization and data science.
In my PhD thesis, I developed connections between combinatorics and persistent homology, a key tool in topological data analysis.
In addition to my PhD work, I also conducted research for Los Alamos National Lab as a graduate intern in the Information Systems and Modeling Group (A-1). This research focused on solving discrete optimization problems on graphs for applications to epidemiology.

## Projects

In my free time, I love tinkering and applying my skills to personal projects. Check out my github or the "Blog Posts" page above for details on what I've been working on!
